Description: Contains functions to calculate the 95% confidence interval for
    the difference between the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of
    two datasets. The package contains two functions: one for two dependent
    datasets and one for two independent datasets. The method for calculating
    the confidence intervals is found in Ramasundarahettige et al. (2009)

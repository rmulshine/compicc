Title: Confidence Interval for the Difference of ICCs
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Riley Mulshine
Maintainer: rmulshi2@nd.edu
Description: The compicc package contains 2 functions (dep_ci and indep_ci) that
    each calculate the 95% confidence interval for the difference between
    the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of two datasets. The dep_ci
    function is used when the two datasets are dependent, meaning the same
    subjects were tested in both datasets. The indep_ci function is used when
    the two datasets are independent, meaning different subjects were tested
    from one dataset to the next.
